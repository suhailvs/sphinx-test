The Django Book
===============

Welcome to the online version of The Django Book, a free book about the Django Web framework for the Python programming language.

.. admonition:: About this edition   

   This book is a fork of http://github.com/jacobian/djangobook.com/. Since it is **no longer maintained** by the user. We are working on getting the book updated to cover Django versions 1.6, 1.7 and beyond. But we need your help, we're making this book warts and all `open source`__ in the hopes that it will find love as a community project.

   So, if you'd like to help out, `hop on over to GitHub`__ and send us a pull request!
